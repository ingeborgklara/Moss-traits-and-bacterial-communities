This study explores the relationships between moss functional traits and the structure of moss and soil bacterial communities, including nitrogen fixation potential and soil properties across a deglaciation chronosequence.

## Data Access

- Data are available via Zenodo: [10.5281/zenodo.7313340](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7313340)

## File Description

- **Metadata.xlsx**: Contains moss traits, _nifH_ gene abundance, acetylene reduction rates, and time since deglaciation for each moss and soil sample.
- **Soildata.xlsx**: Includes pH and soil moisture content for bare and moss-covered soil samples.

## Usage

To use the data:
1. Download the files from this repository or Zenodo.
2. Refer to the column headers in each file for variable descriptions.
3. Use the data for analysis of moss traits, bacterial community structure, nitrogen fixation, and soil properties.
